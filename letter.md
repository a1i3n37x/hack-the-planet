Re:  Notice of Revocation of Acceptance & Demand for Cure
     2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee (VIN 1J8GR48K68C103590)

1.  **Statement of Facts**  
    I am a recently rehoused U.S. Air Force veteran who purchased the above Jeep from Clark Auto on **[purchase date]** for **$___**, paying **$2,000 down**.  
    After only **≈ 1,500 miles**, the engine catastrophically failed and the vehicle was towed back to your lot on **[tow‑in date]**.  
    A Grease Monkey oil‑service invoice and the attached CARFAX entry dated 04/16/2025 confirm proper oil level and service less than a week before failure.

2.  **Legal Basis**  
    • **Revocation of Acceptance – C.R.S. § 4‑2‑608.**  
      A buyer may revoke acceptance when a non‑conformity “**substantially impairs**” value and was hard to discover pre‑sale or warranted by seller assurances. *Homier v. Faricy Truck*, 784 P.2d 798 (Colo. App. 1989), ordered rescission for a catastrophic defect that appeared after ≈ 1,700 miles. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}    
    • **Colorado Consumer Protection Act – C.R.S. § 6‑1‑105(1)(u).**  
      Concealing or failing to disclose a known material defect is a deceptive trade practice; the CCPA authorizes **treble damages and attorney fees** (*Rhino Linings USA v. Rocky Mountain Rhino Lining*, 62 P.3d 142 (Colo. 2003)). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
    • An “**AS‑IS**” disclaimer does **not** bar revocation (§ 4‑2‑608) nor shield a seller from fraud or CCPA liability. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

3.  **Demand – Select ONE remedy within 14 calendar days of receipt**  

    | OPTION | Terms |
    |--------|-------|
    | **A. Full rescission** | • Cancel the retail‑installment contract.<br>• Refund my $2,000 down payment **and** any subsequent payments.<br>• Return any trade‑in (or its cash value).<br>• Remove the Jeep at your expense. |
    | **B. Zero‑cost engine replacement** | • Verified 3.7 L engine **≤ 100 k mi** (VIN & CARFAX disclosed).<br>• Written **12 mo/12 k mi parts‑and‑labor warranty**.<br>• **No change** to APR, term, or total of payments.<br>• Vehicle returned to me **within 30 days** of this letter; credit **$25/day** thereafter.<br>• Retain failed long block intact for my inspection. |
    | **C. Repair credit** | • Pay **$3,500** so I may engage my own shop.<br>• Retail‑installment contract otherwise unchanged. |
    | **D. Interest‑free repair note** *(only if you refuse A‑C)* | • Dealer advances $1,500 toward swap.<br>• I repay **$50/mo for 30 months (0 % APR)**; note **unsecured** (non‑payment ≠ vehicle default).<br>• Same warranty & 30‑day deadline as Option B. |

4.  **Document Request (48 hours)**  
    Please provide copies of: (1) Buyer’s order & retail‑installment contract; (2) FTC Buyers Guide; (3) All internal repair orders/notes since tow‑in.

5.  **Spoliation Notice**  
    Do **not** discard, disassemble, or alter the failed engine; I reserve inspection rights.

6.  **Consequences of Non‑Compliance**  
    Failure to elect an option **in writing by [date + 14 days]** will prompt:  
    • Small‑claims action in Mesa County for rescission (§ 4‑2‑608) and CCPA treble damages;  
    • Formal complaints to the Colorado Auto Industry Division and Attorney General;  
    • Public reporting via BBB and consumer channels.

This notice is sent **without prejudice** to all other rights and remedies.

Respectfully,
